# GitHub Actions Workflow: Build and Release APK
# 
# This workflow automatically builds an Android APK when a GitHub release is published.
# The APK is named with the release version (e.g., TimeTracker-v1.0.2.apk) and attached
# to the release as a downloadable asset.
#
# Requirements:
# - Release tag must follow format: v{major}.{minor}.{patch} (e.g., v1.0.2)
# - Repository must have GitHub Actions enabled
# - GITHUB_TOKEN has write permissions to releases (default)
# - GitHub Secrets configured: KEYSTORE_BASE64, KEYSTORE_PASSWORD, KEY_ALIAS, KEY_PASSWORD
