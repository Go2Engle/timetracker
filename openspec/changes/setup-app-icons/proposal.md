# Proposal: Setup App Icons

## Overview
Integrate custom app icons from IconKitchen-Output into the Flutter time tracker application for Android, iOS, and web platforms.

## Background
The project has a complete set of platform-specific app icons generated by IconKitchen and stored in `assets/IconKitchen-Output/`. These icons are currently not integrated into the app's build configuration. The app is using default Flutter placeholder icons on all platforms.

## Motivation
- **Professional appearance**: Custom branded icons instead of default Flutter placeholders
- **Platform compliance**: Proper icon formats and sizes for Android (adaptive icons), iOS (app icon set), and web (PWA icons, favicon)
- **User experience**: Recognizable app icon in launcher, recent apps, notifications, and browser tabs

## Proposed Solution
Copy and configure the IconKitchen-generated icons into each platform's expected location:

1. **Android**: Copy adaptive icon resources (mipmap folders) from `assets/IconKitchen-Output/android/res/` to `android/app/src/main/res/`, replacing existing placeholder icons
2. **iOS**: Replace icon image files in `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` with icons from `assets/IconKitchen-Output/ios/` and update Contents.json to match IconKitchen's naming scheme
3. **Web**: Copy web icons from `assets/IconKitchen-Output/web/` to `web/icons/`, update `web/manifest.json` with correct icon references, and add favicon to `web/index.html`

## Scope
This is a **tooling and configuration change** that:
- Replaces placeholder assets with custom icons
- Updates platform-specific configuration files (Contents.json, manifest.json, index.html)
- Does not modify any Dart code or application logic
- Does not introduce new features or capabilities

## Implementation Approach
Direct file copy and configuration updates following IconKitchen's platform-specific instructions:
- Android: Overwrite mipmap directories (supports adaptive icons with background/foreground/monochrome layers)
- iOS: Update AppIcon.appiconset with all required sizes (iPhone, iPad, CarPlay, Marketing)
- Web: Update manifest.json icons array and add favicon link in HTML head

## Risks & Considerations
- **Icon quality**: Assumes IconKitchen output meets platform guidelines (size, format, margins)
- **Build cache**: May need `flutter clean` to see icon changes in development builds
- **iOS build**: Requires Xcode project rebuild; icon changes won't appear until app is reinstalled
- **Git tracking**: IconKitchen output folder should remain in assets for reference; actual icons deployed to platform folders

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Android app displays custom icon in launcher and recent apps
- [ ] iOS app displays custom icon on home screen and in app switcher
- [ ] Web app displays custom favicon in browser tab and PWA icon when installed
- [ ] All icon sizes render correctly without distortion or artifacts
- [ ] App builds successfully for all platforms with no icon-related warnings

## Related Work
None - this is a standalone configuration improvement

## Open Questions
None - IconKitchen provides complete platform-ready icon sets with clear integration instructions
